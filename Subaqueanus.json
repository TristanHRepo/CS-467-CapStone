Could it be?\nYou turn the head lamp of your suit on and see a bubble floating straight up. You are under water.\nYou observe your surroundings and see you are completely submerged in a large body of water. The gate behind you faintly glowing. Under your feet is a sandy floor. No signs of life yet, but the environment leaves you feeling vulnerable. \nYou establish North on this planet using your onboard compass system. To the North you see an opening in the world. A dark abyss. It seems to be some type of cave. To the South, you see the faintly glowing gate.",
